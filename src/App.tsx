        I just wanted to take a moment to share something that's been on my
        mind. You are such an empathetic, sunny, and sweet person, and every day
        I feel incredibly lucky to have you in my life. Your warmth and kindness
        never fail to brighten my day, and I cherish the moments we share
        together. Over time, my feelings for you have grown deeper, and I can't
        help but smile when I think about all the wonderful memories we've
        created. You mean the world to me, and I truly appreciate everything you
        do. I would love to take this next step with you and see where this
        beautiful journey leads us.
